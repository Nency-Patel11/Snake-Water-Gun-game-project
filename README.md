# Snake-Water-Gun Game

A simple Python game inspired by the classic "Rock-Paper-Scissors," where you play against the computer.  
This project is part of my journey to learn Python and start building coding projects.

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script in your terminal or IDE:
   ```bash
    snake-water-gunGame.py
Choose your move by typing one of the following:

s for Snake

w for Water

g for Gun

The computer will randomly choose its move, and the winner of each round will be displayed.
